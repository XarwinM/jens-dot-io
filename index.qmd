# Welcome to my website!

Hi, 
I am Jens and this is my website. Here, I share topics I’m passionate about, ranging from mathematics and machine learning to futuristic speculations. 

A few words on my background and interests: I pursued and earned two master’s degrees — one in mathematics and the other in computer science. Beyond that, my curiosity led me to explore and study diverse fields, including psychology. 
During my time at Heidelberg University, I conducted research in machine learning, focusing on challenges related to distribution shifts. My work addressed broad questions like *“How can we make reliable predictions when circumstances change?”* (robustness, domain generalization) and *“How can we detect when shifts and failures occur?”* (OOD detection, failure detection, selective classification). I’ve published papers on these topics and completed my PhD in the process.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at Diamant Software, primarily focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
